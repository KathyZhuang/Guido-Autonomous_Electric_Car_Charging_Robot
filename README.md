# Guido-Autonomous_Electric_Car_Charging_Robot
This project is designing mechatronics system through designing and building an autonomous solution (no human control/interaction) for plugging in an electric car charger.

The goal is to design a solution that could accurately plug in an electric car charger into a charging port.The testing environment is setup to simulate an electric carparked in the garage by a driver, the charging port position could thus be anywhere within a 0.5m x 1m rectangle, facing at any slight angle. Your design is allowed to be set up initially ina 1.5m x 2m rectangle, before the test fixture (the car) arrives in the charge port zone.The design is required to locate the charge port and plug in the charger plug autonomously within a 2 minutes testing time.
